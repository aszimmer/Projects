## Sentiment Analysis Model

**Project description:** sentiment analysis built in Pythong using TextBlob. TextBlob is an API that facilitates natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, and translation work.

### Problem Statement
Natural Learning Processing (NLP) is critical for computers effectively communicating with humans. NLP is what makes it possible for computers to interact with all kinds of speech (reading/hearing/speaking/etc).

### Results and Implications
The model successfully processed basic speech and returned positive precision, recall, and F1 scores. 

### Limitations
This model was built to process basic speech and requires additional processing in order to handle more complex and nuanced speech.
