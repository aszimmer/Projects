## Predictive Analysis of Graduation Rates

**Project description:** a predictive analysis completed in Python that categorized students into graduates or non-graduates

### Problem Statement

Academic success is a critical barrier in bolstering socioeconomic growth. Significant dropout rates are a barrier that learning partners need to be empowered to address. Graduates have a higher earning potential and are overall less likely to be unemployed. 

### Results and Implications

The final model performed at approximately 86% accuracy and is ready to be deployed as an informational tool.

### Limitations
The data utilized in this analysis is sensitive in nature and was publicly sourced without PII to protect student anonymity. Ethical data colection and analysis was pertinent to prevent bias, manipulating, or influence of results. Educational ethics and considerations were also taken into consideration, which includes providing any relevant data caveats and limitations. 

There are general limitations to how well the data can inform and portray people and their actions. The predictive model is only meant to guide and inform learning providers and any other users.
