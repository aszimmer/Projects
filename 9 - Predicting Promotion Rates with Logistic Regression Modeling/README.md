## Logistic Regression Modeling

**Project description:** a logistic regression model executed in Python that seeks to accurately determine whether an employee is ready for a promotio within the organization. 

### Problem Statement
Understanding promotability within an organization is important to both the employee and the employer for 3 key reasons-
1. Understanding Potential: employers can proactively look to start training and developing employees in key business areas and improve employee retention.
2. Professional Development: leaders can use findings as a tool to develop employee reports' strengths anda reas of improvement
3. Reduce Bias: standardizing promotion qualities can reduce implicit human bias in selecting employees for promotion

### Results and Implications
The final logistic regression model's accuracy was approximately 80%. Features that resulted in the highest impact include department, average training score, and awards won. Least impact included number of trainings, gender, and the recruitment channel from which they were hired.

### Limitations
The dataset required for this type of work is sensitive in nature; thus the data used was fabricated to mimic a real-world organization. For real-world applcations, ethical data collection and analysis is pertinent to prevent bias, manipulating of data, or unfair influence over results. The project was not meant to wholly represent what population is suitable for a promotion and is only meant to act as a guiding tool for quality conversations in the workplace.
