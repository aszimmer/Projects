##  Cluster Analysis

**Project description:** cluster analysis done in Python using Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) data.

### Problem Statement

ALS is a rare disease. To better understand ALS, researchers must collect a large amount of data in order to create clinical trials and potential biomarkers by evaluating patterns, relationships, and symmetries. 

### Results and Implications
Evaluation of the sillhouette scores and plots shows how similar an object is to its own cluster. If the sillhouette score is large, the point belongs to the cluster it is in. As seen in the full code, this project resulted in inconsistent sillhouette scores with a high variability. The ultimate sillhouette score had an elbow score of 7, which was the most accurate in terms of clustering similar objects together. 


### Limitations
This project was an introductory dive into clustering methods and requires further refinement for optimal results. the ALS data is sensitive to scale and would benefit from further exploratory analysis and tuning.
