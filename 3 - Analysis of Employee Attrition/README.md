## Descriptive Analysis of Attrition Within a Business

**Project description:** a descriptive analysis completed in Python that utilized multiple different data sources--API, website, and exported files. The project sought to provide insights on a sample population of employees paired with benchmark unemployment rates, job marketability, and salary rate information.

### Problem Statement

The goal of the project was to better understand how to work with multiple data sources intuitively to pull together a broader analysis project.

### Results and Implications
The biggest takeaway from this project can be seen more closely in [Project 2](Project02.Mmd), which dives into the API work done to pull individual-level data in aggregate.


### Limitations
The scope of the project pulled from disconnected data sources that resulted in limited generalized statements but was a strong exercise in manipulating data for analsysis and market research.
