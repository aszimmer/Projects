## API Pull and Analysis

**Project description:** part of a broader analysis effort; this project involves using the Reed API to pull job posting information in aggregate within Python

### Problem Statement

Utilizing real-world data more accurately represents the desired population; having access to large quantities of data through an API facilitates better analysis and results.

### Results and Implications

Parameters are fully customizable and connected to the Reed job postings board. 

### Limitations
API is connected to a UK-based job posting board, so information is geographically limited to their postings.
