## Time Series Modeling

**Project description:** built in Python to predict sales trends using historical sales data. Project also included exploratory analysis to better understand the foundational data frame.

### Problem Statement
Using historical sales data related to previous sales is useful in predicting expected future sales. 

### Results and Implications
Forecasting can be challenging for many reasons, as historical data may not always be comprehensive and future events such as holidays or major marketing promotions are volatile factors of impact. The model performed relatively well but seasonality needs to be taken into deeper consideration to develop an overall more robust model.

### Limitations
While the model is significantly more dynamic than traditional methods, time series modeling is still relatively new and additional work to solidify the historical data of any given organization is required before deployment.
